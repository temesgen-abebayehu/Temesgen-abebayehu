/*Interest on a loan is paid on a declining loan balance, and hence a loan with an interest rate of, 
say, 14 percent can cost significantly less than 14 percent of the loan balance. Write a program 
that takes a loan amount and interest rate as input and then outputs the monthly payments and 
balance of the loan until the loan is paid off. Assume that the monthly payments are one 
twentieth (1/20) of the original loan amount including monthly interest paid. The monthly 
interest payment is computed as (remaining loan balance * interest rate)/12, and that any 
amount in excess of the interest is credited toward decreasing the balance due.*/
